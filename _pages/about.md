I am Jiuheng He, a Ph.D. candidate specializing in Science and Technology Studies (STS) at Cornell University. My research interests center around the social impact of AI, interpretability of machine learning algorithms, knowledge production by generative AI, and expertise studies.

My dissertation, titled “The Go Community and AlphaGo: An Ethnographic Study of an Encounter with AI”, explores the interaction between Go AI and human Go experts since the victory of AlphaGo over Lee Sedol in 2016. Ever since then, the role of AI in the Go community rapidly changed from being an underdog challenger to being the ultimate authority about Go in less than three years.

By focusing on the case of Go, my dissertation will examine the following questions: how did the Go community initially respond to the development of ML systems that can defeat the world’s best players? How do Go players understand the expertise and knowledge generated by machine learning algorithms? What are the emerging practices in the Go community since Go AI became the authority of Go knowledge?
